This is a hangman-style word game.

My personal styling updates include:
- colors of the 'wrong' and 'chosen' button classes
- added more margin to h2 class so win/lose screen has better spacing from tht top
- added margin to h1 class so game-over message wouldn't be so crowded
- changed color of shown letters to be more neutral and on-theme
- changed font to more of a courier-letter style
- added letter spacing to h2 style
- title screen is bold, play screen is normal style
